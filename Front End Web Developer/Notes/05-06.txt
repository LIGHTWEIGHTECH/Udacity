A proxy object sits between a real object and the calling code. The calling code interacts with the proxy instead of the real object. To create a proxy:

use the new Proxy() constructor
pass the object being proxied as the first item
the second object is a handler object
the handler object is made up of 1 of 13 different "traps"
a trap is a function that will intercept calls to properties let you run code
if a trap is not defined, the default behavior is sent to the target object
Proxies are a powerful new way to create and manage the interactions between objects.
